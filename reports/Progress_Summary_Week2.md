## Progress Since Last Meeting (July 26)

### Completed Tasks

1. **Literature Review** 
   - Reviewed and analyzed 25 papers across 5 categories
   - Identified key gaps in AI-specific phishing detection
   - Created comprehensive literature matrix with annotations

2. **Threat Modeling**
   - Developed taxonomy of 4 AI-specific attack types
   - Defined attacker capabilities and resources
   - Created risk prioritization matrix

3. **Project Setup**
   - Established GitHub repository structure
   - Set up development environment (Python, TensorFlow)
   - Created comprehensive documentation framework

### Current Work in Progress

1. **System Design**
   - Drafting architecture for detection system
   - Evaluating ensemble learning approaches
   - Designing feature extraction pipeline

2. **Data Collection Planning**
   - Identifying public datasets (PhishTank, VirusTotal)
   - Planning synthetic data generation approach
   - Exploring partnerships for real attack data

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Data Availability**
   - Limited public datasets for AI-specific phishing
   - Solution: Plan to generate synthetic attacks

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Balancing detection accuracy with <200ms latency
   - Solution: Investigating lightweight models and caching

## Next Two Weeks Plan (by August 23)

1. Complete system architecture design
2. Implement basic feature extraction module
3. Begin synthetic attack data generation
4. Set up TensorFlow Serving test environment
5. Draft requirements specification document

## Questions for Discussion

1. Should we prioritize breadth (all 4 attack types) or depth (focus on 1-2 types first)?
2. What level of mathematical rigor is expected for the threat model?
3. Any specific conferences you recommend targeting for publication?
4. Access to GPU resources - should I use GWU HPC or cloud services?

## Resource Needs

- GPU access for model training (NVIDIA A100 preferred)
- API credits for PhishTank/VirusTotal data access
- Potential collaboration with AI service providers for real data

## Key Metrics

- Papers reviewed: 25/25 (100%)
- Threat model: Complete
- System design: 30% complete
- Implementation: 10% started
- Timeline: On track
