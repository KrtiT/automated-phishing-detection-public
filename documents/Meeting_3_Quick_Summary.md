   - Threat model with mathematical formulation
   - System architecture with component specs
   - Evaluation methodology

2. **Implementation Progress**
   - Baseline Random Forest (89% accuracy, 145ms latency)
   - Dataset parsers for 4/5 sources
   - Preprocessing pipeline 70% complete

3. **Updated Literature Review**
   - 12 new papers added
   - Total: 42 papers from verified sources
   - All mapped to thesis chapters

## Questions for Professor M
1. Is the mathematical rigor in threat model appropriate?
2. Should LLM be part of ensemble or separate verification layer?
3. Include cost-per-query metrics in evaluation?
4. Target IEEE S&P 2026 or faster venue?

## Next Period Goals (by Sep 5)
