# Processed Artifacts (Regeneratable)

Processed feature tables and evaluation artifacts are generated by the
pipeline and are intentionally not committed to the public repository.
Regenerate them with the configuration files under `data/configs/`:

- `python code/data_preprocessing.py --config data/configs/week1_snapshot_v2.yml`
- `python code/train_baselines.py --config data/configs/week1_snapshot_v2.yml`
- `python code/evaluate_baselines.py --config data/configs/week1_snapshot_v2.yml`

Outputs will be written to versioned snapshot folders under
`data/processed/` (e.g., `v2025.12.10/`, `v2025.public_millions/`).
See `data/README.md` for snapshot details.
