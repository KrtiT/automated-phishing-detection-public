# Data Retrieval Scripts

This folder is reserved for any curl/wget helpers used to download the
public feeds (OpenPhish, PhishTank, URLhaus, Umbrella, Majestic). The
public repository omits raw datasets, but you can add lightweight
download scripts here if needed.

Refer to `data/README.md` for the exact snapshot filenames and access
dates used in the thesis experiments.
