# Raw Data (Not Stored in Public Repo)

The public GitHub repository excludes raw datasets to keep the footprint
manageable and to respect data sharing constraints. Recreate the expected
layout by placing your downloads in subfolders under `data/raw/`:

- `data/raw/openphish/`
- `data/raw/phishtank/`
- `data/raw/urlhaus/`
- `data/raw/benign/` (Umbrella + Majestic lists)
- `data/raw/telemetry/` (sanitized local extracts)
- `data/raw/jailbreak/` and `data/raw/redteam/`

See `data/README.md` for the exact snapshot filenames, access dates, and
retrieval guidance.
